# Tokenization Infrastructure in Europe

This repository contains notes, perspectives and reference material on
regulated tokenization infrastructure in Europe.

The focus is on infrastructure, not product innovation:
custody, settlement, regulation, market structure and operational resilience.

## Key topics
- Tokenization of financial instruments
- Stablecoins as settlement infrastructure
- Corporate treasury use cases
- MiCAR and regulatory harmonisation in the EU
- Real-world assets (RWAs)
- Marketplaces and interoperability
- Regulated custody and post-trade infrastructure

## Context
Tokenization is often discussed as a technological concept.
In practice, scalable adoption depends on market-ready infrastructure
and regulatory clarity.

This repository accompanies broader writing and discussions on how
tokenized markets may move from pilots to production-grade infrastructure
over the coming years.
